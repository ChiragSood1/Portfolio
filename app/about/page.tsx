      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem", maxWidth: "60ch" }}>
        I’m Chirag, a software developer interested in building clean and
        reliable web applications. I enjoy learning how things work under
        the hood and improving my skills through hands-on projects.

        This portfolio is a work in progress where I’ll be adding more
        projects and experiments over time.
