      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem", maxWidth: "60ch" }}>
        I'm a Computer Science student and a Software Engineer-to-be, with a strong interest in developing practical, efficient, and scalable software applications. I enjoy developing applications according to the idea behind them, with a focus on design and functionality.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem", maxWidth: "60ch" }}>
        I have, over the course of my career, explored various domains in software development and have realized a growing passion for backend development and systems, alongside frontend development as the occasion demands.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem", maxWidth: "60ch" }}>
        Currently, I am working on improving my skills in Java, Python, SQL, and Data Structures, along with projects to allow me to apply them in a practical world. I think in terms of code that is as simple as possible, yet no simpler, with clarity first, then cleverness.
      </p>

      <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem", maxWidth: "60ch" }}>
        My specific interests include backend programming, full-stack applications, data management, and problem-solving using code. I prefer learning new tools and technologies, creating applications from scratch, and progressing further from a knowledge standpoint.
